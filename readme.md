# GraphQL JSON Web Token authenticator

This module provides a JWT-interface for creating JSON Web Tokens for authentication.

## Installation

`composer require firesphere/graphql-jwt`

The default config is available in `_config\config.yml`. 

To set your signer key and UID prefix, add the following to your `.env`:
```
JWT_PREFIX=mysupersecretprefix
JWT_SIGNER_KEY=mysupersecretkey
```

Or, if you want to use a public and private key, set the following in your `.env`:
```
JWT_SIGNER_KEY="path/to/your/private.key"
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY="path/to/your/public.key"
```

Currently, only RSA keys are accepted, ECDSA is not supported.

Please note, the keys in the test-folder are generated by an online RSA key generator.

# _*THE KEYS IN THE `TESTS/KEYS` FOLDER CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!*_

## Log in

To generate a JWT token, send a login request to the `createToken` mutator. E.g.:
```
mutation {
  createToken(Email: "admin", Password: "password") {
    Token, // Required, or you won't get a token back
    ID,
    FirstName,
    Surname
  }
}
```

## Validate token

If you have an app and want to validate your token, you can address the `validateToken` method. E.g.:
```
query validateToken {
    validateToken {
      Valid
      Message
      Code
    }
}
```

It only needs to call the endpoint. The token should be in the header, via your middleware for the request, as a `Authorization: Bearer 1235'piue,,54fxdg5`

If the token is valid, you'll get a response like this:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "validateToken": {
            "Valid": true,
            "Message": "",
            "Code": 200,
            "__typename": "ValidateToken"
        }
    }
}
```

And obviously the `response['data']['validateToken']['Valid']` is false when the token is invalid.

## Anonymous tokens

Although not advised, it's possible to use anonymous tokens which returns a member with an ID 0 and name Anonymous.
To enable anonymous tokens, add the following to your configuration yml:
```yaml
Firesphere\GraphQLJWT\JWTAuthenticator:
  anonymous_allowed: true
```

## Enable CORS

To use JWT, CORS needs to be enabled. This can be done by adding the following to your projects config:

```yaml
SilverStripe\GraphQL\Controller:
  cors:
    Enabled: true # Off by default
    Allow-Origin: '*' # Deny all by default
    Allow-Headers: 'Authorization, Content-Type'
    Allow-Methods:  'GET, POST, OPTIONS'
    Max-Age:  86400  # 86,400 seconds = 1 day.
```

## Usage

After logging in, you will receive a token which can be used for further requests. This token should be in the header of the request with the `Bearer` as signature, e.g.:
```
Authorization: Bearer 123456789ctmbxkjup.euidhtcgcfdiupyefuqdjihkdthdn
```
(That is not an actual valid token.)

## Security

Currently, the default method for encrypting the JWT is with Sha256.

JWT is signed with multiple factors, including the host, audience (app/remote user), a secret key and a timeframe within which the token is valid.

Only one device can be logged in at the time.

## Supported services

By default, JWT only supports login. As it's tokens can not be disabled, nor used for password changes or resets.

## Caveats

When using php under CGI/FastCGI mode with Apache, the `Authorization` header might not work correctly, see [issue#15](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-graphql-jwt/issues/15). The workaround is simple, just add `SetEnvIf Authorization .+ HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$0` in your `.htaccess` file ([refer](http://php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php#114877)). 

## Examples

A Postman collection can be found in the `extra` folder.
